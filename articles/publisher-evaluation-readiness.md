Jorge had done everything right in his initial submission. His narrative puzzle-platformer was polished, his pitch was professional, and his demo impressed the publisher’s evaluation team. A week later, he received the response he’d been hoping for: enthusiastic interest and a request for detailed documentation to begin a full internal review.

He felt ready. After all, he’d put so much care into his pitch and his demo. He had a game design document, a basic timeline, and a rough budget. He believed those would be enough.

Three weeks later, the rejection arrived. The email was polite but clear:

> “Documentation suggests the team isn’t prepared for structured development processes.”  
> “Business planning appears immature for partnership requirements.”

Jorge’s game hadn’t changed in those three weeks. His skills hadn’t vanished overnight. What changed was the lens publishers were using to evaluate him. In that moment, it wasn’t about whether his project looked promising—it was about whether his team looked ready to deliver on it professionally.

This is the difference between **submission readiness** and **evaluation readiness**. One gets you noticed, the other earns trust.

## Why Evaluation Readiness Matters

When a publisher decides to explore your project more deeply, it means you’ve already cleared the first hurdle: convincing them your game is worth their time. But at this point, the question shifts from *“Do we want to learn more?”* to *“Can this team deliver and collaborate with us at a professional level?”*

The evaluation phase is when publishers start to imagine what it would actually feel like to invest their money, credibility, and resources in your work. They aren’t just reviewing your game anymore—they’re reviewing you.

Good documentation doesn’t exist to impress people with formatting or jargon. It exists to help each part of the publisher’s team—business development, marketing, technical directors, finance, and executives—understand what you’re building and how you’ll get there. When your materials are clear and thorough, they answer critical questions that every publisher asks sooner or later:

- Can this team communicate across disciplines without confusion?  
- Have they thought through the realities of production and risk?  
- Will they be able to maintain alignment and transparency over months or years of collaboration?

This stage is often the first true test of whether you can handle the complexity of a professional partnership. Strong preparation doesn’t guarantee a deal, but it signals that you take your work—and their work—seriously.

## What Evaluation Materials Prove (and When You’ll Need Them)

Every publisher has their own process, but most evaluations revolve around the same core materials. Together, these documents do more than explain your game—they show whether you’re prepared to deliver it in a structured, collaborative environment.

### Game Design Document (GDD)

The first document most publishers request is your Game Design Document. At a glance, they’re looking for **clarity of vision**. Does your GDD clearly explain your game’s core loop, systems, and creative goals? Can someone who has never played your build understand what makes your game compelling?

In most cases, this is the earliest document you’ll be asked for, often alongside a demo. A professional GDD demonstrates not only creative ambition, but your ability to communicate that ambition to others.

### Technical Design Document (TDD)

As discussions progress, publishers typically request your Technical Design Document. Here, they want to understand whether you have the **technical capacity** to build what you’ve pitched.

The TDD describes your game’s architecture, tools, performance expectations, and any technical risks you’ve identified. Publishers don’t expect every question to be resolved, but they do expect evidence that you’ve thought through feasibility and made realistic plans to address challenges.

### Production Plan and Risk Assessment

This document shows how you intend to get from your current milestone to a finished, market-ready release. A strong production plan is **conservative rather than optimistic**. It includes milestones and buffers that reflect the reality that things will change, and it explains how you’ll adjust if they do.

Publishers reviewing your production plan are essentially asking themselves: *Will this team stay on track, or will we be constantly putting out fires together?*

### Budget and Financial Plan

Your Budget and Financial Plan is where transparency becomes especially important. Clear, well-organized budgets help publishers understand not just **how much funding you need**, but **how you’ll allocate it responsibly**.

A thoughtful financial plan also demonstrates that you recognize the connection between funding, timelines, and scope. This document often comes into focus before any offer or term sheet is drafted, and it can be a deciding factor in whether a publisher feels confident enough to proceed.

### Market Analysis and Commercial Strategy

By the time you share your Market Analysis and Commercial Strategy, the publisher has already decided your project is feasible. Now, they’re evaluating whether it’s **commercially viable**.

You don’t have to be a marketing expert, but you should be able to describe:

- Who your audience is  
- What your game provides them  
- Why they’ll care enough to buy it

Evidence of research—whether that’s platform data, competitor benchmarks, or community engagement—makes this document stronger.

### Partnership Proposal and Terms Framework

This document isn’t always formal, but it always matters. It’s your opportunity to describe:

- What you’re looking for in a publishing partner  
- What kind of support you expect  
- How you envision the relationship working day to day

Publishers read this closely to see whether your expectations align with theirs.

While each of these documents serves a different purpose, together they paint a picture: a team
